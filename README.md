# Blockchain-Integrated Regression Model with Solana and TensorFlow

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of blockchain technology with a machine learning regression model. By leveraging Solana's decentralized blockchain infrastructure and TensorFlow's machine learning capabilities, this project ensures data security, transparency, and tamper-proof predictive analytics.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Utilize Solana blockchain to store and retrieve predictive analytics data, ensuring immutability and transparency.
- **Machine Learning:** Implement a regression model using TensorFlow and Python to perform predictive analysis.
- **Security:** The integration ensures that predictions and data are securely stored on the blockchain, creating a robust and tamper-proof environment for data analysis.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (for writing and deploying Solana smart contracts)
- **Solana CLI** (for interacting with the Solana blockchain)
- **Python 3.7+** (for machine learning tasks and interacting with the Solana blockchain)
- **TensorFlow** (for building and training the regression model)

## Installation

### 1. Set Up Solana Environment

1. **Install Rust:**

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
## Install Solana CLI:

Follow the installation instructions from the official Solana documentation.

### Set up a new Solana program:

```bash
 cargo new --lib my_solana_project
cd my_solana_project
```
### Set Up Python Environment
Install Python:
Download and install Python 3.7+ from python.org.

Install Required Python Packages:

```bash
Copy code
pip install solana borsh-construct tensorflow numpy
```

### Set Up Solana Wallet:

```bash
solana-keygen new
solana config set --keypair /path/to/your/keypair.json
```

Fund your wallet using a Solana faucet if you're on the devnet.

## Usage
### 1. Write and Deploy the Solana Smart Contract
Write the Smart Contract:

Replace the contents of ```src/lib.rs``` with the smart contract provided in the ```solana_contract``` folder.

Build and Deploy:

Build and deploy your Solana program:

```bash
cargo build-bpf --release
solana program deploy target/deploy/my_solana_project.so
```
Take note of the program ID returned after deployment.

### 2. Run the Python Script
Train the Regression Model:

Implement and train your TensorFlow regression model in Python.

Store Predictions on Blockchain:

Use the provided Python script (run_model.py) to interact with the Solana blockchain and store the predictions securely.

```bash
python run_model.py
```
Monitor Transactions:

Check the transaction on Solana's devnet explorer to ensure that the data has been recorded.

### Extra
Local Testing: You can run a local Solana validator for testing without deploying to the devnet.

```bash
solana-test-validator
```
Deployment on Mainnet: After testing, consider deploying to the Solana mainnet for a live environment.
